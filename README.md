# Flooring in Augmented Reality (FAR)

FAR is an attempt to create an augmented reality Android app for visualizing different flooring (carpet, tile, wood, etc) in a space. It improves upon the state-of-the-art for flooring visualization apps by providing a high quality solution that works in real-time with minimal input from the user. The system is able to segment the floor and handle floor occlusion without requiring user input.
